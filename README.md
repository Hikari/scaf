# The Sixie Opinionated Django Cookiecutter

This is a work in progress, but it is heavily inspired by the work
of [cookiecutter-django](https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django)
and Daniel Roy Greenfeld. It also borrows heavily from the ideas in the
PyPA [warehouse](https://github.com/pypa/warehouse) as I feel they have 
made an amazing developer onboarding experience for a very complicated
project.
